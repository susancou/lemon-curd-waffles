# lemon-curd-waffles
github suggested literate-parakeet for a repository name.  My parakeets are not literate and are called lemon curd and waffles (I didn't name them).  this is non-class random storage.


I am taking INFO 201 this quarter.  While I have used git a long time ago, I was editing other users stuff and didn't create files or project, etc.  This'll be fun.
